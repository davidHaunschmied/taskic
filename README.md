# Taskic - Productivity through simplicity
Taskic is an app that enables you to keep focus on the important things.

It's based on the Ivy Lee method and build with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

### The Ivy Lee Method
Named by the man who created it, the [Ivy Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Lee) method is a simple five-step strategy to become more productive. These steps are:
1. **Write it down:** At the end of the day, write down your **6** most important tasks you want to get done the next day
1. **Prioritize:** Order the tasks from most to least important one
1. **Focus:** ... **on only one task at a time!** Work **exclusively** on the task with the highest priority until it is done. Avoid any distractions.
1. **Cleanup:** Celebrate finished tasks, move unfinished tasks to the list for the next day.
1. **Secret sauce: Routine!** Repeat this process every working day.

#### How does the app work
This is a standalone app without any dependency on a remote server or database. It also requires no login.
Any data is stored in the local app storage directly on the device.

#### Disclaimer
I developed this app mainly to get started with React Native. While the correctness of the app is ensured, the maintainability
is not optimal due to some duplicated code fragments and lack of React Native expertise.
