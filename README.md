# Taskic - Productivity through simplicity

---
Taskic is an app that enables you to keep focus on the important things.

It's based on the Ivy Lee method and build with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

### The Ivy Lee Method
Named by the man who created it, the [Ivy Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Lee) method is a simple five-step strategy to become more productive. These steps are:
1. **Write it down:** At the end of the day, write down your **6** most important tasks you want to get done the next day
1. **Prioritize:** Order the tasks from most to least important one
1. **Focus:** ... **on only one task at a time!** Work **exclusively** on the task with the highest priority until it is done. Avoid any distractions.
1. **Cleanup:** Celebrate finished tasks, move unfinished tasks to the list for the next day.
1. **Secret sauce: Routine!** Repeat this process every working day.
